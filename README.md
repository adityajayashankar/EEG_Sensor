DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANALOF EEG SENSOR
Project Aim: Design and implement a cost-effective, high-sensitivity, low-noise analog EEG sensor with a complete layout ready for tape-out. This sensor will support accurate brain signal acquisition and seamless integration into brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, fostering wider accessibility and innovation in neurotechnology.
